# College Scorecard Analytics Project

[The College Scorecard project](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov) aggregates data that are provided through federal reporting from institutions, data on federal financial aid, and tax information.  These data provide insights into the performance of schools that receive federal financial aid dollars, and the outcomes of the students of those schools. The project intends to provide data to help students and families compare college costs and outcomes as they weigh the tradeoffs of different colleges, accounting for their own needs and educational goals.

This project was inspired by a recent [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/college-scorecard).

Data are analyzed in R and results displayed in RMarkdown.  Data are provided in the included Zip archive.
